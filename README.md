#Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website I will use to display my projects and skills. It is built using Next.Js's static site generation. It isn't currently hosted anywhere, as it is a work in progress, but you may use the steps below to run the website for yourself.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Cloning the Project

To clone the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CooperKozitza/Portfolio.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Portfolio 
```

Install the project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. You can now access the website at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Building for Production

To build the project for production use:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate a `.next` folder with the production build. You can start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
